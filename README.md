## Development

### Testing
Run the test suite:
```bash
pytest
```

View test coverage:
```bash
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html
```

### CI/CD Pipeline
The project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and testing. The pipeline:
- Runs on Python 3.9
- Executes unit tests with pytest
- Performs code quality checks with flake8
- Scans dependencies for security vulnerabilities
- Generates test coverage reports
- Builds the package

Required GitHub Secrets:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key for testing
- `CODECOV_TOKEN`: Token for uploading coverage reports (optional)

### Code Quality
Before submitting a PR:
1. Run tests: `pytest`
2. Check code style: `flake8`
3. Check dependencies: `safety check`

## Deploying to Databricks Apps

### Prerequisites
- Access to a Databricks workspace with Apps enabled
- Admin privileges to manage secrets and environment variables
- Git repository access

### Deployment Methods

#### Method 1: Using Databricks UI
1. **Upload App Files**
   - Go to your Databricks workspace
   - Click **Workspace** in the sidebar
   - Upload your app files to a designated folder

2. **Deploy the App**
   - Click **Compute** in the sidebar
   - Go to the **Apps** tab
   - Click your app name in the **Name** column
   - Click **Deploy** and select your app folder
   - Review configuration and click **Deploy**

#### Method 2: Using Databricks CLI (Recommended)
1. **Sync Files to Workspace**
   ```bash
   databricks sync --watch . /Workspace/Users/your-email@org.com/databricks-chatbot-app
   ```

2. **Deploy the App**
   ```bash
   databricks apps deploy databricks-chatbot \
      --source-code-path /Workspace/Users/your-email@org.com/databricks-chatbot-app
   ```

### Configuration
The app uses `app.yaml` for deployment configuration:
- Python version: 3.9
- Memory: 4-8 GB
- CPU: 2-4 cores
- Required secrets: OPENAI_API_KEY

### Post-Deployment
1. **Monitor Deployment**
   - Check the app overview page for deployment status
   - View logs in the **Logs** tab for debugging

2. **Access Control**
   - Configure user access in the **Permissions** tab
   - Set appropriate permission levels

3. **Updates and Maintenance**
   - Push code changes to the repository
   - Redeploy using the same method as initial deployment
   - Monitor app performance and logs

### Troubleshooting
- **App Fails to Start**
  - Check logs in the App's "Logs" section
  - Verify all required secrets are set
  - Ensure Python version matches app.yaml

- **Performance Issues**
  - Check resource utilization in logs
  - Consider adjusting memory/CPU allocation
  - Monitor response times

- **SSL Warnings**
  - If you see urllib3 SSL warnings, ensure your environment uses OpenSSL 1.1.1+
  - Consider upgrading urllib3 or your SSL implementation

### Best Practices
- Regularly update dependencies
- Monitor app usage and logs
- Back up chat history periodically
- Test updates locally before deploying
- Use version tags for stable releases 

## Additional Development Dependencies

To install additional development dependencies, use the following command:
```bash
pip install pytest pytest-cov flake8 safety build
